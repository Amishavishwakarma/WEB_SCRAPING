Web scraping is a term used to describe the use of a program or algorithm to extract and process large amounts of data from the web. Whether you are a data scientist, engineer, or anybody who analyzes large amounts of datasets, the ability to scrape data from the web is a useful skill to have. Let's say you find data from the web, and there is no direct way to download it, web scraping using Python is a skill you can use to extract the data into a useful form that can be imported.

In this, we scrap the MDBI data. There is too much movie data we are   having so we scrap only 250 Bollywood movies data, and there all details like(cast, language, country, and all).
